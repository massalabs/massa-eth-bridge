# Bridge Project


## Goals

In the context of blockchain, a bridge refers to a technology or solution that enables interoperability between different blockchain networks. It allows for the transfer of assets, from one blockchain to another without the need for a centralized exchange. We want to make a decentralized bridge using Smart Contract in the form of HTLC.

## Why HTLC ?

HTLC (Hash Time-Locked Contracts) are smart contracts on a blockchain that allow for secure transactions using the hash function of the blockchain. In an HTLC, the transfer of funds is locked until a specified condition is met, typically the provision of a specific hash proof. This enables parties to trust each other without needing mutual trust, which is particularly useful for cross-border transactions and cryptocurrency payments.
